More testing would be nice to ensure that the interface works as expected.

An example should be added for how to use this library.

Ideally it would be tested on 64 and 32 bit machines, as I'm not sure
whether the use of "int" in the C source will cause problems here.
I tried to use isize and usize to make this okay, but for some casts it
might still be a problem.
